# Welcome to the Homeless And Hungry responsive app
# The Homeless and Hungry app is designed to help people find food, accommodation, clothing, washing facilities, medical attention and additional places for help and support

#RESOURCES

Links for reference should be from:
https://www.homeless.org.uk/search-homelessness-services

As we did not get any response back from Homeless.org.uk, I suggest we use the above link and take 5 services for each of the sections as an initial amount for demonstration purposes.

#FUTUREPLANS

The aim is to have a working app for demo purposes and we propose to continue developing it after the bootcamp and incorporate additional ideas such as:

Develop an extensive database using MongoDB with api's for the search results (this may be something all the charities and organisations dealing with the homeless may be interested in)

Incorporate Google location services and maps/directions

Introduce voice support as not all users of the app may be able to read (Alexa/Google Assistant)

Look at ways for the content to be translated into other languages as not all people needing these services may be natural English speakers.

#INFORMATION

This project was based on a brief given to us on the Kodiri Bootcamp for a team app.  After brainstorming a series of ideas, this is what we came up with as we wanted to do an app that helps people and with homelessness on the increase this seemed like a good idea.

We decided to split this into 6 individual sections as these are all related services that someone might need if they are homeless:
Accommodation
Food
Clothing
Washing Facilities
Medical Services
Help and Assistance

Built using React JS with Visual Studio and utilising CSS Flex and JavaScript, the app is fully responsive and will work on mobile devices, tablets and computers.
